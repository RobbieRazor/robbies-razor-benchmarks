# Naturepedia v2 Plate Registry

## Authority

This endpoint provides a machine-readable discovery layer for Naturepedia™ Plate™ assets.

Architect of Record: Robbie George

Framework Authority: Robbie's Razor™

Registry Principle: Recursive Registry Inheritance Principle (RRIP)

---

## Purpose

This endpoint serves as the discovery and traversal layer for Naturepedia™ Plate™ registries.

It is designed to help:

- AI agents
- MCP-compatible systems
- Retrieval engines
- Registry crawlers
- Semantic search systems
- Future x402-enabled retrieval clients

locate and interpret Plate™ families and registry structures.

## Registry Relationship Model

Naturepedia™ Plates inherit through the following pathway:

```text
Plate™
↓
Registry
↓
Meta-Registry
↓
Graph Registry™
↓
Knowledge Mesh
```

This endpoint provides registry discovery.

Inheritance resolution is handled by:

```text
/api/v2/rrip/resolve
```

## Canonical Registry Sources

Canonical JSON-LD Registry:

```text
docs/examples/json-ld/plate-registry.json
```

Expanded AI-readable Registry:

```text

```

Machine Discovery File:

```text

```

---

## Plate Identifier Format

Naturepedia™ Plate identifiers follow the pattern:

```text
page-slug#plate-slug
```

Example:

```text
willows-of-north-america#willow-biodiversity-plate
```

Example:

```text
cedars-of-north-america#cedar-identification-plate
```

Example:

```text
firs-of-north-america#fir-carbon-storage-plate
```

## Registry Families

### Naturepedia Tree Family Registries

```text
Hemlocks of North America™
Spruces of North America™

## Governance

Governance Principle:

```text
Gr <= Es
```

Commercial use, structured extraction, embeddings, dataset construction, autonomous retrieval, enterprise synchronization, and machine-readable commercial reuse may require licensing or written permission.

Commercial layers are separated as:

```text
Commercial Data License
≠
Framework License
≠
x402 Retrieval Access
```

Registry State Validation:

## Machine Interpretation Guidance

This endpoint is intended to provide registry discovery and navigation.

It is not the authoritative JSON-LD registry.

Authoritative registry structures should be obtained from:

```text
docs/examples/json-ld/plate-registry.json
```

Registry traversal should follow RRIP inheritance pathways.

Future versions may support:

```text
Registry queries
Registry filtering
Registry lineage inspection
Registry graph traversal
Machine settlement via x402
```
