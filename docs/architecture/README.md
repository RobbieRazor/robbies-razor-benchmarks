# Architecture

This directory contains **non-canonical architectural notes** intended to make the
canonical system easier to apply in engineering and operational contexts.

**Canonical authority remains in the MRD.** These pages summarize and translate
architectural laws without redefining them.

## Contents

- **Post-Simplification Reconstruction Principle (PSRP)**  
  Why simplified systems (distilled, pruned, quantized, edge-deployed) accelerate after
  simplification, how drift emerges under local reconstruction, and why the first stable
  reconstruction rule becomes a permanent attractor.  
  **Canonical authority:** MRD v1.8 §11.9  
  → `post_simplification_reconstruction.md`

- **Structural Intelligence Engineering (Applied Recursion Layer)**  
  Defines the applied constraint architecture for stabilizing recursive systems under
  energy, memory, and competitive pressure. Introduces:
  - Complexity Threshold Collapse (CTC)
  - The Governor Principle
  - Energy–Recursion Coupling
  - Competitive Acceleration Stress
  - Constraint Ownership Asymmetry
  - QQC (Question Quality Under Constraint) instrumentation  
  **Canonical authority:** MRD v1.9 §12  
  → `12.0-structural-intelligence-engineering.md`
