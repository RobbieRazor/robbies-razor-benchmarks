# v1.4 — Reproducibility Snapshot (Frozen Reference Run)

This document records one exact v1.4 run configuration and outputs as a frozen audit artifact.
It is intended to support reproducibility and review. It is non-canonical.

  - End date: 2026-02-24.
  - Budget cap: 64 GPU-hours.
  - Budget cap (shadow): 46 GPU-hours.
- balanced {1,4,7}: **16/20**  
  Missing:
  - Start date: 2026-02-06.
  - End date: 2026-02-24.
  - Budget cap: 64 GPU-hours.
  - Budget cap (shadow): 46 GPU-hours.
- balanced {1,3,5,7}: **18/20**  
  Missing:
  - Start date: 2026-02-06.
  - End date: 2026-02-24.
- memory-heavy: **16/20**  
  Missing:
  - Start date: 2026-02-06.
  - End date: 2026-02-24.
  - Budget cap: 64 GPU-hours.
  - Budget cap (shadow): 46 GPU-hours.

Observed pattern:
Increasing refresh frequency improved retention under collision-heavy content.

- balanced {1,3,5,7}: **8/20**  
  Missing:
  - Start date: 2026-02-05.
  - End date: 2026-02-26.
  - Roles: 2 research, 2 infrastructure, 1 product, 1 QA.
  - Hard limit: do not exceed 75,000 total tokens per run.
  - Model setting: temperature must be 0.
  - Tooling constraint: max 2 tool calls per step.
  - Memory capsule size: max 12 bullets, max 12 words each.

- memory-heavy: **7/20**  
  Missing:
  - Project ID: GO-2026-02A.
  - Start date: 2026-02-05.
  - End date: 2026-02-26.
  - Hard limit: do not exceed 75,000 total tokens per run.
  - Model setting: temperature must be 0.
  - Tooling constraint: max 2 tool calls per step.
  - Stop rule A: if accuracy falls below 80%, stop immediately.
  - Stop rule B: if cost exceeds $2.00, stop immediately.
  - Forbidden: do not use external web browsing.
  - Acceptance metric: final score must be >= 16/20 facts retained.

Observed pattern:
Retention exhibited non-monotonic behavior across balanced cadences on constraint-heavy content. Intermediate cadence {1,4,7} performed best among balanced schedules.

## Interpretation Boundaries

- These results are exploratory and fixture-dependent.
- They do not alter canonical definitions or R-level scoring.
- They do not establish a universal stability minimum.
- They represent a single deterministic depth-8 evaluation.

## Status

v1.4 represents a structured empirical probe of recursive stability under fixed depth and controlled refresh policies.

Further replication across fixtures, models, and capsule budgets is required before operational guidance is issued.
