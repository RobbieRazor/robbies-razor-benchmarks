# Physics Unification — Research Note

## Scope and Intent

This document is a **research note** intended to contextualize Robbie’s Razor
within a broader class of *medium-first* interpretations of intelligence.

It does **not** claim experimental validation in physics.
It **does** propose a structural mapping between:

- Deterministic, locality-constrained computation
- Confidence-gated memory substrates
- Medium / propagation metaphors used in several contemporary unification efforts

The canonical specification for Robbie’s Razor remains defined in the
**Master Reference Document (MRD v1.8)**.  
This note is explanatory and comparative.

## The Engineering Observation

Failure modes in large language models—such as hallucinations, non-local jumps,
and unstable continuations—can be interpreted as **propagation through an
ill-defined computational substrate**.

Robbie’s Razor addresses this by enforcing:

- Local transitions
- Confidence-gated memory access
- Stability accumulation across recursive steps

In this framing, **truth emerges from structure and locality**, rather than
post-hoc tuning or probabilistic suppression.

## Conceptual Alignment (Analogy Only)

| Informal Concept | Robbie’s Razor Mechanism | Engineering Interpretation |
|------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|
| Graded medium | φ-recursive lattice constraints | Variable resistance to invalid continuations |
| Refraction | Stability-weighted traversal | Valid paths bend toward coherence |
| Attraction | Lattice Stability Score (LSS) | Meaning accumulates where structure holds |
| Locality | Memory gating + adjacency | Non-local hallucinations cannot propagate |
| Untuned constants | Geometric constraints | Stability emerges from structure, not fitting |

These correspondences are **analogical**, not evidentiary.

## “Waves All the Way Down” (Computational Reading)

Within Robbie’s Razor:

- Tokens are not treated as independent particles
- They are **events propagating through a constrained substrate**
- The substrate determines which paths remain coherent under recursion

If the substrate is consistent, propagation remains stable.
If not, instability appears as hallucination or rejection.

## Abstract (Research Framing)

> **Abstract: Convergence of Recursive Geometry and Medium-Based Computation**  
>  
> Robbie’s Razor proposes that the hallucination floor in large language models
> is not solely a data or alignment problem, but a substrate problem.
> By enforcing locality, confidence gating, and recursive stability within
> a structured memory lattice, inference shifts from a flat stochastic process
> to a medium-like propagation regime.
>  
> In this framing, truth is not selected post hoc, but emerges as the only
> path that remains stable under recursive traversal. This document situates
> the Razor alongside broader medium-first interpretations of intelligence,
> without asserting experimental physics validation.

## Relationship to This Repository

- **Theory & Canon** → Maintained in the MRD (external to this repository)
- **Executable Substrate** → Implemented in `src/razor/`
- **Validation Surface** → Defined by benchmarks in `benchmarks/`

This separation is intentional and supports independent evaluation.
