## Layer Clarification

§11.4 Stability Minima describes optimal recursive balance *within a fixed computational budget*.

This section defines the **physical origin and expansion limits of that budget**.

The Stability Minimum operates internally.
The Physical Substrate Constraint Field operates externally.

## 1. Definition

All recursive intelligence systems operating in physical reality are bounded by substrate constraints, including but not limited to:

- Energy generation and delivered megawatts
- Power distribution infrastructure (substations, transformers, switchgear)
- Compute fabrication capacity (accelerators, packaging, yield cycles)
- Memory bandwidth and interconnect ceilings
- Thermal dissipation and cooling limits
- Material supply chains (e.g., copper, silicon, rare earth inputs)

These constraints function as an external compression field governing the rate at which recursion may scale.

## 2. Core Invariant

Let:

Gᵣ = Recursive compression gain per iteration  
Eₛ = Physical substrate expansion rate  

A recursive system remains structurally stable when:

Gᵣ ≤ Eₛ

If recursive gain persistently exceeds substrate expansion capacity:

- Infrastructure saturation emerges
- Capital efficiency degrades
- Queueing and lead-time bottlenecks increase
- Orchestration overhead grows
- Drift pressure intensifies

Runaway amplification collapses into constraint-governed behavior.

## 3. Observable Signature

Under real-world constraint, recursive acceleration typically manifests as:

Step-change capability gains  
→ followed by infrastructure-limited plateau  
→ followed by renewed acceleration once substrate expands  

This produces punctuated growth rather than unbounded singularity.

---

## 4. Razor Coherence Condition

Compression → Expression → Memory → Recursion  
must remain energetically and materially coupled to its substrate.

When recursion attempts to amplify faster than its physical compression field can support, instability results.

Therefore:

Unbounded runaway recursion is physically inconsistent.  
Stabilized acceleration is the natural attractor under constraint.

---

## 5. Canonical Interpretation

This section does not redefine Stability Minima (§11.4).  
It defines the physical boundary conditions within which Stability Minima operates.

Together they describe:

Internal equilibrium (Stability Minimum)  
+  
External bounding field (Substrate Constraint)  
=  
Constraint-stabilized recursion.
