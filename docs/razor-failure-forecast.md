# Razor Failure Forecast  
## Applying Robbie’s Razor to the Department of War AI-First Strategy (Jan 2026)

**Framework:** Robbie’s Razor — *compression → expression → memory → recursion*  
**Claim:** The DoW AI-First strategy will fail first where **recursion is accelerated faster than compression and memory integrity can support**.

This document identifies **early failure points**, **observable signals**, and **Razor-correct mitigations**.

---

## Failure Point 1: Data Access Acceleration → Memory Poisoning

**Policy trigger:**  
Mandated federated data catalogs across all classification levels with rapid approval timelines.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Compression is skipped (no enforced normalization, ontology alignment, lineage).
- Expression (agents, models) is layered directly on heterogeneous data.
- Memory becomes internally inconsistent before recursion begins.

**Failure symptom:**  
- Identical questions yield divergent “authoritative” answers across teams.
- Confidence increases while agreement decreases.

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Rising semantic variance per query  
- Duplicate “ground truth” objects with different timestamps  
- Increased reconciliation work downstream

**Why it breaks first:**  
Recursion amplifies inconsistencies when memory is dirty.

## Failure Point 2: 30-Day Model Refresh Mandate → Institutional Amnesia

**Policy trigger:**  
Requirement to deploy frontier models within 30 days of public release.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Expression velocity prioritized over memory continuity.
- Model updates overwrite reasoning pathways faster than they can be recorded.
- Recursion loses reproducibility.

**Failure symptom:**  
- “Why did the system recommend X last quarter?” becomes unanswerable.
- Post-incident reviews fail due to non-reconstructable decision paths.

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Rising non-determinism in identical replay scenarios  
- Declining audit trace completeness  
- Increasing rollback frequency

**Why it breaks:**  
Recursion without memory persistence creates institutional amnesia.

---

## Failure Point 3: Enterprise AI Agents → Runaway Recursion

**Policy trigger:**  
Rapid deployment of autonomous enterprise agents across workflows.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Agents are recursion engines by default.
- Without compression constraints (tool budgets, schemas, stop rules), recursion self-amplifies.
- Automation replaces judgment faster than controls mature.

**Failure symptom:**  
- Self-triggering workflows  
- Cascading tickets, requests, or resource allocations  
- Silent cost explosions before detection

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Superlinear tool-call growth  
- Recursive task depth drift  
- Budget exhaustion without corresponding mission gain

**Why it breaks:**  
Unthrottled recursion always outruns governance.

---

## Failure Point 4: Cross-Domain AI Use → Authority Hallucination

**Policy trigger:**  
AI deployed simultaneously across classified and unclassified domains.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Domain boundaries are compression membranes.
- Blurring them collapses epistemic filtering.
- Models inherit *authority tone* without authority provenance.

**Failure symptom:**  
- Outputs treated as fused truth despite mixed source quality.
- Over-trust in agent summaries during time pressure.

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Increased citation ambiguity  
- Rising confidence language decoupled from source certainty  
- Manual verification reintroduced ad hoc

**Why it breaks:**  
Authority without compression is indistinguishable from hallucination.

---

## Failure Point 5: Metric-Driven Competition → Proxy Optimization Collapse

**Policy trigger:**  
“Competition > centralized planning” with success measured via transparent metrics.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Metrics become compression proxies for reality.
- Teams optimize expression to the proxy, not the mission.
- Memory feedback loops drift from ground truth.

**Failure symptom:**  
- Deployment velocity up, operational effectiveness flat or down.
- Dashboard success with field dissatisfaction.

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Metric saturation without outcome improvement  
- Growing divergence between reported impact and operator feedback  
- Increased “exception handling” narratives

**Why it breaks:**  
Bad compression targets generate false recursion stability.

---

## Failure Point 6: Compute & Power Limits → Hard Physical Compression Wall

**Policy trigger:**  
Massive expansion of AI compute and edge deployment.

**Razor analysis:**  
- Power, cooling, and grid access are non-negotiable compression constraints.
- Recursive workloads (agents + refresh cycles) grow faster than infrastructure.
- Expression collapses when compression limits hit.

**Failure symptom:**  
- GPU allocation conflicts  
- Edge AI pilots stall post-demo  
- Priority wars over inference budgets

**Early RDM signals:**  
- Rising cost per marginal insight  
- Latency spikes under load  
- Forced throttling without policy guidance

**Why it breaks:**  
Physics enforces compression whether policy acknowledges it or not.

## The First Crack (Most Likely)

> **Enterprise AI agents operating on accelerated, poorly-compressed data substrates will trigger runaway recursion before governance can react.**

This is the earliest, fastest, and most destabilizing failure mode.

---

## Razor-Correct Non-Negotiables (Mitigations)

To sustain recursion, the system must enforce:

1. **Compression Gates**
   - Canonical schemas  
   - Ontology alignment  
   - Data lineage enforcement per domain

2. **Memory Integrity Instrumentation**
   - Provenance tagging  
   - Reproducibility snapshots  
   - Model-versioned reasoning logs

3. **Recursion Throttles**
   - Tool and call budgets  
   - Stop conditions  
   - Rollback rules  
   - **Semantic Drift / RDM early-warning monitors**

---

## Razor Conclusion

> **AI dominance will not fail from lack of ambition or compute, but from accelerating recursion beyond what compression and memory can support.**

Robbie’s Razor predicts failure **before public incidents**, if the signals are measured.
