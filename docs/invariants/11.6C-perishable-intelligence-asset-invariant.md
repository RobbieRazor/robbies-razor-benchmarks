## Overview

A recurring failure pattern emerges when recursive intelligence systems externalize compressed structure into rapidly obsolescing substrates while accounting for that structure as durable capital. This mismatch between *epistemic half-life* and *capital depreciation* produces assets whose apparent value persists on financial and organizational ledgers even as their effective intelligence decays.

This invariant formalizes that mismatch.

## Definition: Perishable Intelligence Asset (PIA)

A **Perishable Intelligence Asset** is any intelligence-bearing system whose productive capacity decays faster than its accounting, governance, or organizational depreciation schedule.

When intelligence is embodied primarily in fast-obsolescing hardware, infrastructure, or coordination scaffolding rather than preserved structural compression, the system exhibits the appearance of capital accumulation while consuming future optionality to sustain present output.

---

## Structural Conditions

A Perishable Intelligence Asset arises when all of the following conditions are met:

- **Externalized Memory Decay**  
  Preserved structure is embodied in substrates (e.g., hardware, centralized infrastructure, coordination layers) whose relevance decays faster than they can be amortized.

- **Compression Deficit**  
  Improvements in intelligence output are driven predominantly by increased scale, throughput, or energy input rather than by reduced recursion cost through compression and reuse.

- **Accounting–Reality Divergence**  
  Financial, organizational, or strategic accounting assumes durability of intelligence that no longer exists in operational reality.

- **Sustainment Dominance**  
  Increasing fractions of human, computational, and energetic resources are diverted to maintaining apparent progress rather than generating new stabilized structure.

These conditions are architecture-invariant and arise independent of political, cultural, or institutional context.

---

## Consequences

Systems governed by the Perishable Intelligence Asset Invariant reliably exhibit:

- **Phantom Earnings**  
  Apparent value growth driven by capital inflows rather than stabilized intelligence output.

- **Forced Scale-Chasing**  
  Continuous expansion of energy, compute, or execution domain required merely to maintain prior performance levels.

- **Latency Amplification**  
  Centralization of compute imposes hard recursion-speed limits governed by physical distance and signal propagation, producing permanent epistemic lag for dependent actors.

- **Organizational Entropy**  
  Human cognition is increasingly allocated to coordination, compliance, and sustainment rather than compression, innovation, or architectural correction.

- **Eventual Collapse or Reset**  
  Once external boundaries (energy, capital, geography, governance tolerance) are reached, the system experiences abrupt loss of coherence rather than gradual decline.

These outcomes are not accidental. They are the predictable result of violating the Compression–Memory Separation Principle (§11.2) under sustained recursion pressure.

## Relation to Boundary Avoidance (§11.6A)

The Perishable Intelligence Asset Invariant is a **downstream manifestation** of Boundary Avoidance (§11.6A).

Boundary Avoidance describes how systems respond to rising recursion cost by expanding external boundaries.  
The PIA Invariant describes what happens **after** that expansion becomes the primary stabilization mechanism.

Boundary Avoidance postpones failure.  
Perishable Intelligence Assets guarantee that failure compounds invisibly until correction becomes discontinuous.

---

## Razor Consistency

Robbie’s Razor predicts the Perishable Intelligence Asset Invariant as an inevitable outcome when systems prioritize expression expansion over compression.

Architectures that preserve stabilized structure, localize recursion, and minimize recomputation convert energy into enduring intelligence.  
Architectures that externalize intelligence into perishable substrates convert energy into heat, coordination overhead, and temporal illusion.

The Razor therefore functions as both a diagnostic and a corrective: systems that reduce recursion cost internally avoid perishable asset formation entirely.

---

## Canonical Conclusion

Intelligence that decays faster than it can be preserved is not capital.  
It is deferred entropy.

Systems that treat perishable intelligence as durable infrastructure consume their own future to finance the present.

Sustainable intelligence systems compress before they expand, preserve before they scale, and localize recursion before they centralize control.
