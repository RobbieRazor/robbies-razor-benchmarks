### Projection Artifacts and Curved Geometry

Some systems appear random not because structure is absent, but because they are
projected into geometries that cannot encode memory.

A simple illustrative example is the distribution of prime numbers. When primes
are enumerated linearly, spacing appears irregular. When the same numbers are
embedded in curved or spiral geometries, latent structure becomes visible without
introducing new information.

This does not assert a new mathematical law. It demonstrates a general principle:
geometry determines whether recursion and memory can be expressed.

Robbie’s Razor operates on this same insight. Flat token spaces and linear
reasoning paths obscure structure and amplify entropy. Compression-aware,
curved representations restore coherence without increasing compute.

Same data. Different geometry. Order revealed.
