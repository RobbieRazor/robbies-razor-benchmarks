# Recursive Stability Under Constraint
**Executive Technical Brief v1.0**

This document provides a concise, engineering-facing overview of a structural stability principle for recursive reasoning systems operating under resource constraints.

## What it covers
- Compression–memory separation as a stability requirement
- Stability minima under constraint (compute-heavy drift vs memory-heavy rigidity)
- Predictable scaling failure modes (recomputation overhead, drift amplification, objective interference)
- Practical implications for long-horizon reasoning stability
