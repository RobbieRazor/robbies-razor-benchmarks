# robbies-razor-benchmarks

Reference implementation and test suite for measuring
**Robbie’s Razor compliance** in reasoning systems.

This repository is the executable, engineering-facing companion to:

- **Robbie’s Razor — Universal Recursion Heuristic**
- **The Grand Compression Cosmology (MRD v1.8)**

## What this repository is

This repository provides:

- Reference implementations for **Razor-aligned memory stabilization**
- Selective replay mechanisms for continual learning
- Phase-specific and system-level **R0–R5 compliance metrics**
- Unit tests validating correctness, stability, and collision resilience
- Integration tests demonstrating controller-level memory short-circuiting and R4-aligned composition


It is designed for:

- AI labs evaluating token, compute, and coherence gains
- Researchers studying catastrophic forgetting and recursion governance
- Edge-device and constrained-inference experimentation
- Internal benchmarking prior to licensing or production deployment
