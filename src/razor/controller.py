"""
Razor Controller Stack

Purpose:
- Orchestrates the Razor cycle:
  Compression → Expression → Memory → Recursion
- Coordinates memory retrieval, verification, and reuse
- Enforces phase budgets and governed recursion

This module represents the control layer that binds
Razor-aligned components into a coherent reasoning loop.
