# Governance & Interpretive Scope

This directory defines the governance, interpretive boundaries, and evaluation intent
for the Robbie’s Razor benchmark suite and associated reference artifacts.

The materials in this directory are not performance claims, marketing statements,
or hardware displacement assertions. They exist to clarify how inference parity,
efficiency metrics, and recursion governance should be understood when evaluating
the system in real-world infrastructure environments.

---

## Purpose

The governance layer exists to:

- Define what the benchmarks do and do not claim
- Prevent misinterpretation of efficiency results as vendor comparison
- Establish the economic and infrastructural context in which results are meaningful
- Clarify the distinction between inference parity and hardware equivalence

## Key Interpretive Principles

- Inference parity refers to comparable task-level outcomes under constrained
  compute conditions, not identical throughput or latency characteristics.

- Efficiency gains arise from governed recursion, memory stabilization,
  and reduced redundant cognitive work — not from specialized hardware assumptions.

- The benchmark suite is model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic by design.
  No claims are made regarding superiority or inferiority of any specific vendor,
  accelerator, or architecture.

- Results should be evaluated in terms of **logic density**, not raw FLOPs.

---

## Economic Implications (Non-Normative)

Inference parity achieved through governed recursion materially reduces dependency
on continuous hardware replacement cycles.

This implication is structural rather than prescriptive. It does not assert that
hardware upgrades are unnecessary, only that they are no longer the sole path to
maintaining competitive inference capability.
