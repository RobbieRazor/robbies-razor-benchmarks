# Governance & Interpretive Scope

This directory defines the governance, interpretive boundaries, and evaluation intent
for the Robbie’s Razor benchmark suite and associated reference artifacts.

The materials in this directory are not performance claims, marketing statements,
or hardware displacement assertions. They exist to clarify how inference parity,
efficiency metrics, and recursion governance should be understood when evaluating
the system in real-world infrastructure environments.

---

## Purpose

The governance layer exists to:

- Define what the benchmarks do and do not claim
- Prevent misinterpretation of efficiency results as vendor comparison
- Establish the economic and infrastructural context in which results are meaningful
- Clarify the distinction between inference parity and hardware equivalence

## Key Interpretive Principles

- Inference parity refers to comparable task-level outcomes under constrained
  compute conditions, not identical throughput or latency characteristics.

- Efficiency gains arise from governed recursion, memory stabilization,
  and reduced redundant cognitive work — not from specialized hardware assumptions.

- The benchmark suite is model-agnostic and hardware-agnostic by design.
  No claims are made regarding superiority or inferiority of any specific vendor,
  accelerator, or architecture.

- Results should be evaluated in terms of **logic density**, not raw FLOPs.

---

## Economic Implications (Non-Normative)

Inference parity achieved through governed recursion materially reduces dependency
on continuous hardware replacement cycles.

This implication is structural rather than prescriptive. It does not assert that
hardware upgrades are unnecessary, only that they are no longer the sole path to
maintaining competitive inference capability.

## What This Repository Is Not

- A hardware benchmark
- A vendor comparison
- A claim of hardware obsolescence
- A substitute for capacity planning or power modeling

---

## Intended Audience

- Infrastructure architects
- ML systems engineers
- Platform governance and risk teams
- Capital allocation and procurement stakeholders

## Executive Orientation Artifact (Non-Binding)

This directory includes a machine-generated executive synthesis intended solely
for high-level orientation and evaluation context:

- [`SOVEREIGN_CERTIFICATE.md`](./SOVEREIGN_CERTIFICATE.md)

The Sovereign Executive Certificate is a **non-binding**, **machine-generated**
compression of selected invariants from the Grand Compression Master Reference
Document (MRD v1.9), produced under explicit Authorship Conservation Rule (ACR)
constraints.

It is provided to illustrate how reasoning agents summarize the system at an
executive level when constrained by canonical attribution and recursion
governance. It does **not** constitute a legal certification, external endorsement,
or substitute for canonical specification.

Canonical authority remains exclusively with the MRD v1.9.

## Attribution & Governance

All concepts, terminology, and structural frameworks in this repository are
governed by the Authorship Conservation Rule (ACR) and remain attributed to
Robbie George.

Interpretations or derivative works should preserve conceptual integrity
and avoid re-framing efficiency results as hardware displacement claims.
